orob is a terminal-based roguelike written by hunj. 
the purpose of this game is to allow the end-user to 
have a minimal roguelike experience without the troubles 
of larger roguelikes.

there is no story behind the game. the goal is to
last as long as possible without dying. each move will
remove one of your life points. he who lasts the longest
wins the game.

WARNING: this game might not be finished! items and
enemies are going to be added given time.

controls that require several keystrokes will be
visualized in tree view.

1. movement

basic movement in all directions is simple. the four
primary directions are displayed here:

            w <- UP
 LEFT -> a  .  s <- RIGHT
            d <- DOWN

and diagonal movements can be done by pressing two of
the four primary directions.

the player cannot move into walls or the void.
